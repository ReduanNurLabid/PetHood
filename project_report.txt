Project Title: Pet Care & Adoption Platform (PetHood)

Technology:
PetHood is an Android mobile application developed using Kotlin programming language and Jetpack Compose, Google's modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which helps separate the UI logic from business logic and data management, making the app more modular, testable, and maintainable. The data layer uses a repository pattern to manage data sources, and the app leverages Android's Room database for local persistence. Navigation between screens is handled using Jetpack Navigation Compose, enabling smooth and type-safe transitions. State management is efficiently handled using Compose's reactive state APIs such as `mutableStateOf` and `remember`.

Project Features:
